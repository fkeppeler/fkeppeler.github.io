I hold a bachelor’s degree in biological sciences from the Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos (UNISINOS, Brazil), a master’s degree in Ecology from the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS, Brazil), and recently I concluded my Ph.D. in Wildlife and Fisheries Science at Texas A&M University. Currently, I'm a postdoc at the Center for Limnology at the University of Wisconsin – Madison. My research area mainly involves the study of the structure and functioning of aquatic communities and socio-ecological systems (e.g., fisheries). Although I love to go to the field, most of my work is done indoors and involve data analysis, computer programming (with R and Python), and scientific writing. During my academic career, I spent a great amount of time presenting my research in scientific conferences, and teaching middle- and high-school students (sciences and biology), undergrads (zoology and environmental resource management), and graduate students (stats and R programming). Another peculiarity about me is that I'm really fascinated about personal finance and investments (I know, this is weird!). If you want to contact me, please just send an email.

Thanks for stopping by!
