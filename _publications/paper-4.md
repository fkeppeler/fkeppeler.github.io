We investigated abundance variations and life history traits (body size, sex ratio, length–weight relationships and condition factor) of two species of annual fish (Austrolebias minuano Costa and Cheffe and Cynopoecilus fulgens Costa) in temporary ponds of southern Brazil. Six samples were taken from small temporary ponds during three annual seasons over 2 years (2008–2009). A total of 104 individuals of A. minuano and 433 individuals of C. fulgens were collected. The abundance of both species tended to decrease from autumn to spring in the 2 years. The overall sex ratio of A. minuano and C. fulgens were 1.0 male to 1.8 females and 1 male to 1.04 females, respectively. Juveniles of both species occurred only in autumn over the two years and no adult was observed during this season. While the length–weight relationship of A. minuano indicated hyperallometric growth, the relationship of C. fulgens indicated values close to isometric growth.
